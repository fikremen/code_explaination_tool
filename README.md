# code_explaination_tool
A python tool to help users learn programming and debug their code

The program begins by receiving user input to determine whether code is provided from the terminal or a local file. It then partitions the code into manageable chunks, loads them into a table in the EvaDB database, and generates a summary of the code. User questions about the code are processed using OpenAIâ€™s LLM, ChatGPT, and responses are displayed.
